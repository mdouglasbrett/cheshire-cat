TODO: I originally tried to use latest for every dep in the exercise, but found that I was having trouble getting
Leiningen to launch a cljs repl or compile the ClojureScript. Would be worth investigating later...

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:
